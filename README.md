## Hobbytime tech

### Networking

I love making things talk to each other over the wire, both physical hardware and network protocols.

### Tooling

Always on the lookout for tools that make engineering more fun. Neovim, starship, k9s, zellij, pass, zoxide, fzf, jq, gron, you name it.

### Homelab

I build my own PCs and hunt for routers, switches, and components to build the mesh that serves my needs. Currently working on a hybrid cloud + on-prem solution utilizing Kubernetes for managing backups and secure accessibility from anywhere in the world.
